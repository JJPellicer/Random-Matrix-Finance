# Random Matrix Finance TFG

**Random Matrix Finance TFG** is a project developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis in Physics at the **University of Barcelona**, focused on applying tools from **Random Matrix Theory (RMT)** to the analysis of financial data.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim is to explore the correlation structure among financial assets using RMT, with emphasis on:

- Detecting non-trivial structures in the correlation matrix.
- Identifying collective market behavior.
- Extracting dominant market modes.
- Visualizing connections between different markets and asset classes.

## 🧪 Methodology

The analysis is based on daily data from a diverse set of financial instruments (indices, derivatives, and bonds), and includes:

- Logarithmic return computation and correlation analysis.
- Spectral decomposition of empirical correlation matrices.
- Comparison with theoretical predictions from RMT.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and visual exploration.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`
- Jupyter Notebooks
- LaTeX (for the written thesis document)
- Theoretical framework: *Random Matrix Theory* (Bouchaud & Potters)

## ⚠️ Note

While the main results and plots are presented in English, some variable names and comments in the code are in Spanish, as the original development was done in that language.
